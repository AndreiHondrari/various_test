# Design patterns - Facade

## Overview

Unify interfaces of multiple subsystems under one simpler interface.

## Use cases

- when you have to duplicate the same series of steps and using the same
collection of instances and subsystems

## Dissection

- **Subsystem component** - the instances that do the actual work
- **Facade** - the unificator of the subsystem components which exposes a
unique, simpler interface
