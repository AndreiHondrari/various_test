# Design Patterns

## Overview

Throughout the examples in this collection we will look at
commonality and variability of **structure**, **instantiation**, **behaviour**
and **concurrency** by looking at the following aspects:
- amount (how many?)
- location (where does it occur?)
- lifetime (when does it start and when does it end?)
- frequency (how fast?)
